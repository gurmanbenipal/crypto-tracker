## CODE PREVIEW! üî¨ (SEARCHING FOR A COIN USING AN API) 
```javascript
 
 //this function is to show us the coin when we search for them 
async function index(req, res, next) {
  const coinId = req.query.coinId;
  if (!coinId) {
    return res.render('search', { coin: null, error: null });
  }
  //in case the user uses all capitals , this will make sure everything is sent in lowercase
  const formattedCoinId = coinId.toLowerCase();

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${ROOT_URL}/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&ids=${formattedCoinId}`);
   //here we convert the json response sent by the api to javascript 
    const coinData = await response.json();
    //here we grab the array thatll be given by the api even if its the only array
    const coin = coinData[0];
    //now if the coin is not found we will send back an empty coin array and well show an error
    if (!coin) {
      return res.render('search', { coin: null, error: 'Coin not found' });
    }
    // we are using the built in javascript method to convert the price formate to a more user friendly usd format
    const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' });
    //now we will just give that formate to our coin price 
    coin.current_price = formatter.format(coin.current_price);
   //now if everything works fine we will send our coin and make sure the error is null because our ejs is excpecting it 
    return res.render('search', { coin, error: null });
// to be safe we will also need a way to catch all errors so here it is  
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return res.render('search', { coin: null, error: 'An error occurred' });
  }
}
